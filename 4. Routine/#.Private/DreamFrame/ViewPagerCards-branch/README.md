# ViewPagerCards
ViewPager cards inspired by Duolingo

From my blog post: https://rubensousa.github.io/2016/08/viewpagercards

This is just a sample project.

There's support included for Fragments and normal Views. Check the CardPagerAdapter and CardFragmentPagerAdapter classes.

**What you could do with this:**

1. Showcasing premium features
2. An app intro
2. A small gallery of images
